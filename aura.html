        <h2 class="mb-4">AURA Questions</h2>
        <ol>
			<li>
			<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>What are Aura components in Salesforce, and how do they differ from Lightning Web Components (LWC)?</strong></span></p>
			<p><em>Answer:</em> Aura components and Lightning Web Components (LWC) are both frameworks for building UI components in Salesforce. Aura components are older and use the "aura:" namespace, while LWC is the modern framework using the "lightning:" namespace. LWC is more performance-oriented and allows for better encapsulation.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Can you explain the key features and advantages of using Aura components?</strong></span></p>
			<p><em>Answer:</em> Aura components offer reusability, encapsulation, and event-driven architecture. They provide a framework for building dynamic and interactive components that can work together seamlessly within the Salesforce ecosystem.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>How do you create an Aura component in Salesforce? What are the essential components of an Aura bundle?</strong></span></p>
			<p><em>Answer:</em> To create an Aura component, you need to define the component in a bundle. The essential components include an .cmp file (markup), a .js file (controller), and a .css file (styling). You may also include other resources like helpers and design files.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>What is the role of the Aura definition bundle in an Aura component?</strong></span></p>
			<p><em>Answer:</em> The Aura definition bundle contains metadata for the component, including its attributes, dependencies, and interfaces. It defines the structure and configuration of the component.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>What is the difference between client-side and server-side controllers in Aura components?</strong></span></p>
			<p><em>Answer:</em> Client-side controllers are used for handling events and interactions on the client side (browser). Server-side controllers are used for making server requests and performing server-side logic.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>How do you handle events in Aura components? Explain the different types of events in Aura.</strong></span></p>
			<p><em>Answer:</em> Events in Aura components allow communication between components. There are application events (for global communication), component events (within a component), and system events (e.g., initialization events). You can use the "aura:registerEvent" tag to define and handle events.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>How do you pass data between Aura components? Can you explain the various methods to achieve this?</strong></span></p>
			<p><em>Answer:</em> Data can be passed between Aura components using component attributes, events, or application-level data sharing (e.g., Lightning Data Service). Attributes and events are the primary means of passing data between components.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>What is the Lightning Component framework, and how does it relate to Aura components?</strong></span></p>
			<p><em>Answer:</em> The Lightning Component framework is a framework for building components in Salesforce. Aura components are built using this framework. They are a type of component built with the Lightning Component framework.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>What is the significance of the "lightning:" namespace in Aura components, and how is it used?</strong></span></p>
			<p><em>Answer:</em> The "lightning:" namespace is used for building Lightning components, which are typically more performant than Aura components. It denotes that the component is part of the modern Lightning framework.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Describe the Aura Component life cycle. What events are fired during the initialization and rendering of an Aura component?</strong></span></p>
			<p><em>Answer:</em> The Aura Component life cycle includes the creation, rendering, and destruction phases. Key events are "init," "render," and "destroy." The "init" event is fired during initialization, and the "render" event is fired during rendering.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>How can you access and manipulate component attributes in Aura components?</strong></span></p>
			<p><em>Answer:</em> Component attributes can be accessed using component markup or JavaScript controller methods. For example, you can access an attribute named "myAttribute" in markup using {!v.myAttribute} and in the controller using component.get("v.myAttribute").</p>
			
			</li>
			<li>
			<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Explain the concept of component composition in Aura. How can you create reusable components?</strong></span></p>
			<p><em>Answer:</em> Component composition involves building larger, more complex components by combining smaller, reusable components. You can create reusable components by breaking down your UI into smaller parts and then using them in various parent components as needed. This promotes code reusability and maintainability.</p>
			
			</li>
			<li>
			<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>What is the importance of the "force:" namespace in Aura components? How does it relate to Salesforce data and records?</strong></span></p>
			<p><em>Answer:</em> The "force:" namespace provides access to Salesforce data and records within Aura components. It is used for data manipulation, including retrieving, creating, updating, and deleting records. It facilitates integration with Salesforce data and services.</p>
			
			</li>
			<li>
			<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>How do you handle component security and access control in Aura components?</strong></span></p>
			<p><em>Answer:</em> Security in Aura components is typically managed through user profiles and permissions in Salesforce. You can use attributes to control component behavior based on user permissions, and Apex controllers can enforce access controls on server-side logic.</p>
			
			</li>
			<li>
			<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Can you compare Aura components with Visualforce and Apex in Salesforce development?</strong></span></p>
			<p><em>Answer:</em> Aura components and Visualforce are both UI frameworks, but Aura is more modern and dynamic. Apex is a server-side language, while Aura is a client-side framework. Visualforce uses a page-centric model, whereas Aura uses a component-based model.</p>
			
			</li>
			<li>
			<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>What are the best practices for optimizing the performance of Aura components?</strong></span></p>
			<p><em>Answer:</em> To optimize Aura component performance, consider using client-side caching, minimizing the use of server calls, reducing the size of components, and avoiding unnecessary rerendering. Profiling and testing are essential for identifying and addressing performance bottlenecks.</p>
			
			</li>
			<li>
			<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>How do you handle client-side and server-side validation in Aura components?</strong></span></p>
			<p><em>Answer:</em> Client-side validation is typically performed using JavaScript in the component's controller. Server-side validation is done by invoking server-side methods in Apex controllers and returning validation results.</p>
			
			</li>
			<li>
			<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>What are dynamic components, and how can they be created in Aura?</strong></span></p>
			<p><em>Answer:</em> Dynamic components in Aura allow you to create components at runtime based on conditions or user interactions. You can use the "lightning:dynamicComponent" tag to create dynamic components by specifying their attributes and type in the markup.</p>
			
			</li>
			<li>
			<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Explain the differences between Aura components and Aura apps.</strong></span></p>
			<p><em>Answer:</em> Aura components are individual UI elements, whereas Aura apps are containers that host one or more components. Apps define the structure of a Salesforce page, while components are the building blocks of those pages.</p>
			
			</li>
			<li>
			<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>How can you deploy and manage Aura components in a Salesforce environment?</strong></span></p>
			<p><em>Answer:</em> Aura components can be deployed using Salesforce's deployment tools, such as Salesforce DX, the Metadata API, or changesets. You can manage them using the Salesforce Setup menu, Lightning App Builder, and the Developer Console.</p>
