		<p><span style="color: rgb(97, 189, 109);"><strong><span style="font-size: 19px;">Data Security and Record Sharing</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: red;"><strong>What is a Profile?</strong></span></p>
<p>A basic requirement for a user creation is profile without selecting a profile user level creation is not possible as it is used to specify all the basic information permissions to object, fields, apps, tabs, apex class, visual force pages, record types, login hours, ip ranges.</p>
<p>A profile is a collection of permissions and settings for users in Salesforce. A user can have only one profile at a time but one profile can be assigned to any user. To create a profile, go to,</p>
<p><strong>Setup-&gt; manage users-&gt; profile-&gt;new profile.</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: red;">What is the sharing setting?</span></strong></p>
<p>In an organization, if a user record needs to be shared to other users then we can use a sharing setting. The record can be set as private, public read-only or public read-write. The access is of two types, external access and internal access.</p>
<p>If the external access is set private, then the customers, portal users cannot see the objects records, they can see only their own account records.</p>
<p>If the internal access is set as public read-only then the internal user can view that user data.</p>
<p>If the internal access is set to a public read-write then they have full access to the records.</p>
<p>To manage sharing setting, go to,<strong>&nbsp;Setup-&gt;security controls-&gt; sharing setting.</strong></p>
<p>Setting an object to Private makes records visible to record owners and those above them in the role hierarchy, and access can be extended using sharing rules.</p>
<p><span style="color: red;"><strong>What is a Role?</strong></span></p>
<p>Roles are technically optional, but it&rsquo;s a good practice to use them. Roles are predominately about sharing records to users. When organization-wide default sharing is set to lower than Public Read/Write for an object, you can use Roles in Sharing Rules to determine which records (and whether they&rsquo;re Read-Only or Read/Write) that users can view. Roles also have a hierarchy like an organization chart, so that the sharing can cascade beyond records users need, but also for managers to access their team&rsquo;s records.</p>
<p>Roles control Records (RR). They are used to control records in salesforce. Each user is assigned with one role. No such configurations like profiles are required for roles. It works with Hierarchy but you need to set up a hierarchy for roles.</p>
<p>To set up roles level hierarchy. Go to, <strong>Setup-&gt; Manage Users-&gt; roles.</strong></p>
<p>For example, Top level role like manager can see all his bottom level roles records. With Role hierarchy, manager role gets record level access for all his below user roles.</p>
<p><span style="color: red;"><strong>What is a Permission Set?</strong></span></p>
<p>Permission Sets are add-ons to Profiles. They generally have the same settings and are used to increase users&rsquo; permissions above what the Profile provides. The benefit to them is that you can give users slightly different permissions without having to create separate Profiles. They reduce the overhead for Administrators in that way. It&rsquo;s useful to think of Profiles as the base set of permissions that many users have in common while Permission Sets are the &ldquo;extra&rdquo; permissions that fewer users need.</p>
<p><span style="color: red;"><strong>What is a Public Group?</strong></span></p>
<p>Public Groups are similar to Roles what Permission Sets are to Profiles. An Administrator can create ad hoc groups of users (naming them individually or by Roles) to be able to share records to them. A common use case is to share records to users of a similar level, say Directors. As there are probably Directors spread throughout the organization, they aren&rsquo;t likely to be under each other in the Role hierarchy, but an Admin could create a Public Group with all of the Director Roles in it and share records to the group.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: red;">What is a Queue?</span></strong></p>
<p>Queues are similar to Public Groups in that they are bespoke groupings of users (named individually or via Roles), but they are used for record ownership rather than Sharing Rules. The classic use is for Cases where you&rsquo;d want to assign an open one to a team of people, so whoever was available first could handle it.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: red;">What is meant by field level security?</span></strong></p>
<p>You can restrict access to the fields for the users using field level security. You can make a field required or read-only, hidden by using field level security.</p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(97, 189, 109);"><strong><span style="font-size: 19px;">Data Modeling</span></strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: red;">What is a lookup relationship?</span></strong></p>
<p>A lookup relationship allows you to relate records to each other, creating a parent-child schema. Generally, this is done between the different objects (such as Accounts and Contacts), but it can be one object (such as Parent Accounts). Relationship fields allow for users to specify how records affect each other and help with reporting.</p>
<p><span style="color: red;"><strong>What is a master-detail relationship?</strong></span></p>
<p>Master-Detail relationships are similar to lookup relationships, but have a few special features. First, Master-Detail allows for Roll-up Summary fields to be created. This relationship type also affects security in that the Detail (or child) record does not have a record owner. It inherits its visibility from the Master (or parent) record. That can be very beneficial, or limiting, depending on your use case.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: red;">What is a Roll-up Summary field?</span></strong></p>
<p>A Roll-up Summary field is available on the master side of a Master-Detail relationship. It allows administrators to aggregate data from related detail records (count them, sum a numeric value on them, etc.) in real time. Ability to have Roll-up Summary fields is the top reason why you&rsquo;d consider a Master-Detail relationship.</p>
<p>A roll up summary is used to calculate the values of the child records and displays in the parent object as a read &ndash; only field. You can sum, count, minimum and maximum the values of the fields of the child object</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: red;">What are different types of fields?</span></strong></p>
<p>Field types define the type of information you expect users to enter for that field. Examples include Text, Number, Date, Currency, etc. It&rsquo;s important to match the field type to the data because it affects your ability to report on and analyze the data.</p>
<p>&nbsp;For example, you could store numbers in text fields, but that would make &nbsp;performing calculations on them needlessly challenging.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: red;">What are Validation Rules?</span></strong></p>
<p>Validation Rules allow you to enforce specific business logic to help with your org&rsquo;s data integrity. You can specify conditions on an object that aren&rsquo;t allowed to exist.</p>
<p>Validation rules are used to validate the data based on the formula or criteria that a user provides. Before saving a record into the database, the validation rule checks whether the entered data is correct or not based on the user given criteria.</p>
<p>To create a validation rule, <strong>go to Setup-&gt; object-&gt; click validation rule.</strong></p>
<p>For example, if you don&rsquo;t want a user to mark an Opportunity as Closed Won if the Account doesn&rsquo;t have a Billing Address. You can add a Validation Rule so that when a user tries, it won&rsquo;t update the Opportunity record and displays an error message explaining what they need to do.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: red;">What if you need roll-ups on a lookup relationship?</span></strong></p>
<p>Sometimes you&rsquo;d like to aggregate child data on a parent record, but you can&rsquo;t use Master-Detail due to the security limitations not aligning with your use case. In those situations, you could write code or use Flow Builder to replicate the functionality of Roll up Summary fields. Most likely, however, you&rsquo;ll want an app from the AppExchange to make configuration easy. In fact, an app like this is one of the first things you should look to install in your org (in a sandbox first, of course.)</p>

<p><span style="color: red;"><strong>What is a junction object?</strong></span></p>
<p>A junction object is a term to describe an object that is designed to have two different parent objects (generally with Master-Detail relationships) which forms a many-to-many relationship. There is nothing labeled &ldquo;junction object&rdquo; within</p>
<p>Salesforce; it&rsquo;s a definition applied to an object based on its function in the data model. A common use case is something like Classes in a school. The school will offer many Courses and have many Students. Each of those will be connected to many Classes.</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 19px; color: rgb(97, 189, 109);">Process Automation</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: red;">What is workflow?</span></strong></p>
<p>Workflow is a simply point and click tool to automate your business logic without writing any code. Whenever a record is inserted or updated in an object, you can perform certain actions using workflow rules. The actions in workflow and approval process are,</p>
<ul>
    <li>New task</li>
    <li>Email alert</li>
    <li>Field update</li>
    <li>Outbound message.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="color: red;">What is a Process Builder?</span></strong></p>
<p>Process Builder is a more advanced automation tool than Workflows. While still following the If This Happens, Then Do That concept, Process Builder allows Admin to control the order of actions as well as offering more actions such as creating records, posting to Chatter, and launching other automated tools.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: red;">What is a Flow?</span></strong></p>
<p>Flow is the granddaddy of declarative automation tools. The logic required to perform actions is less rigid than the other tools, so you can do things like branching decisions and looping through actions. You can also perform additional types of actions such as deleting records or creating/editing records unrelated to the original starting point. Finally, Flow is the only declarative automation tool that allows admins to build custom screens to interact with users and can greatly improve the user experience in Lightning (which is required for Screen Flows.)</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: red;">What is an Approval Process?</span></strong></p>
<p>An Approval Process is for very specific automation use cases. Naturally, it&rsquo;s used when something needs to be approved and tracks when and who approved or rejected something. It covers notifying approvers, locking the record from edits, conditional logic for who should approve, and varied approval models (for example, all approvers or any approvers.)</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: red;">What is Apex?</span></strong></p>
<p>Apex is the language in which Salesforce code is written. While a tool for Developers more than Admins, it&rsquo;s important to know that code can extend your org to do pretty much anything you need.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: red;">What is Difference between workflow &amp; approval process?</span></strong></p>
<p>The main difference between workflow and approval process is,&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><span style="color: rgb(97, 189, 109); font-size: 19px;">Communities</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: red;"><strong>What is a Community (Experience Cloud)?</strong></span></p>
<p>A Community is a way that you can allow your customers and partners to access your Salesforce org. With these special licenses, they can have user accounts and a special access portal, customized with a bevy of Lightning features that are able to be configured without any code. It&rsquo;s also very simple to layer in security so they can only see or edit the objects and records you want them to.</p>
<p>Note: Community Cloud was renamed to &ldquo;Experience Cloud&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: red;">What are Guest Users?</span></strong></p>
<p>Guest Users are people without user accounts in your org. They are also called unauthenticated users because they don&rsquo;t need to log in. You can make pages (and data!) publicly available. These users can even create or edit records.</p>
<p>Naturally, there are a lot of considerations and limitations to evaluate, but leveraging this feature can solve a lot of use cases and do it economically as guest user licenses are free.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgb(97, 189, 109); font-size: 19px;">AppExchange</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: red;">What is the difference between managed and unmanaged packages?</span></strong></p>
<p>Applications you install from the AppExchange are in the form of packages &mdash; a collection of all of the elements required to make the app function correctly. The creator of the app decides whether the package is managed or not. At a high-level unmanaged packages, once installed, behave like things you have created yourself in the org, whereas components of managed packages are locked down from being edited, kind of like apps you install on your smartphone.</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 19px; color: rgb(97, 189, 109);">Change Management</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: red;">What is a Change Set?</span></strong></p>
<p>While not exactly the same as an AppExchange package, a Change Set is quite similar. It&rsquo;s a collection of components that you want to migrate between related orgs (generally from a sandbox to Production, but also sandbox to sandbox, and other configurations.)</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: red;">What are the different types of sandboxes?</span></strong></p>
<ol>
    <li>Developer</li>
    <li>Developer Pro</li>
    <li>Partial</li>
    <li>Full sandboxes.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p>The difference is what data is included in the sandbox when it is created or refreshed. <strong>The Developer</strong> ones have no data initially (they differ in the amount of data it can contain) and the <strong>Partial and Full</strong> start with some or all of your Production data. It&rsquo;s important to note that they also differ in how often they can be refreshed:</p>
<p><strong>Developer daily; Partial every five days; Full every 29 days</strong>.</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 19px; color: rgb(97, 189, 109);">User Experience</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: red;">What are Record Types?</span></strong></p>
<p>Record Types allow you to create separate kinds of records for each object. They control the page layouts, picklist values available, and other business logic. A good example is a call center. You&rsquo;d likely need different fields visible and required for Cases involving customers&rsquo; mortgages compared to car loans.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a tip: I almost always create a Record Type when I create a new object even if I&rsquo;m only planning to use one type. It&rsquo;s so much easier to add a second one when you need them than it is to go back and introduce Records Types to an object that already has records.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: red;">What are List Views?</span></strong></p>
<p>List Views are the queries you can present to your users to help them review their records that interest them. Most often found when they click on a tab in an app, but they could also be displayed via Lightning Components on other</p>
<p>Lightning Pages. List Views can be filtered how they are needed and display whichever columns are relevant. Users can also pin their default List View on each tab.</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 19px; color: red;">What are Reports and Dashboards?</span></strong></p>
<p>Reports are similar to List Views, but they can do so much more. They can group records and create summaries.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dashboards allow for visualizations of the data.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: red;">What are reports and their types?</span></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A report is a list of records displayed with certain criteria that users define. The records can be grouped, filtered and sorted based on requirements. We have 4 types of reports they are</p>
<ul>
    <li>Tabular format</li>
    <li>Matrix format</li>
    <li>Summary format</li>
    <li>Joined Format</li>
</ul>
<p>To create a report we need to keep 5 things in mind.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Report Type &ndash; (template, simply object or related objects that you want to create a report).</li>
    <li>Fields &ndash; fields in the objects you want to display in the report.</li>
    <li>Filters &ndash; we have many filters like Field filter, cross filter, row limit, logic filter.</li>
    <li>Format &ndash; Tabular, matrix, summary or joined format</li>
    <li>Folder &ndash; after creating a report you can save it in a public folder or you can create a folder.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;<strong><span style="color: red;">What are Dashboards?</span></strong></p>
<p>A Dashboard is the graphical portrayal of the information produced by a report or different reports. Dashboard part types can be graphs, tables, measures, measurements, or different segments that you can make with Visual Force.</p>
<p>Dashboard has two primary things, information source and segments Information source is the report that you need to show graphically. Part is the kind of graphical portrayal like diagrams, tables and so on. We can have the most extreme of 20 dashboard in a solitary dashboard board.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: red;">What is the page layout? Record types?</span></strong></p>
<p>Page layout is a user interface customization. You can organize buttons, links, fields, related lists, visual force pages and quick actions etc., using page layout.</p>
<p>To create a new page layout, go to,</p>
<p>Setup-&gt; customize\create-&gt; objects-&gt;select an object-&gt;page layout.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can customize the contents of a page for different users using page layout. Record types: By default, you can have only one page layout per profile, if you want to have more than one profile then you have to use record type. It provides different business processes, pick-list and page layouts for users.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: red;">What are Lightning Components?</span></strong></p>
<p>Lightning Components are where the magic of Lightning Experience really comes alive. They are modular features that can be added, moved, or rearranged on Lightning Pages. They are the Record Details, Chatter elements, Highlights Panel,Path display, etc. There are dozens of standard Lightning components and you can also create your own custom Lightning Components or get them from the AppExchange.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: red;">What is the difference between a page layout and a Lightning page?</span></strong></p>
<p>In Lightning Experience page layouts are basically represented by Lightning Components that display its content (mostly the Details and Related List components), but Lightning Record Pages house so much more!</p>
<p>The Lightning Page controls all of the other Lightning Components you can leverage. You can also make all of the components conditionally visible. The conditions can be based on things like the user&rsquo;s profile or data in the record.</p>
<p>There are other types of Lightning pages too: Home pages and App pages. Those pages won&rsquo;t have any individual records, but could enhance the user experience by containing things like charts, list views, Lightning Screen Flows, and more!</p>
<p>The limit is almost anything you can think of to make things better for your users. You can even make Lightning Pages function differently between desktop and mobile instances.</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 19px; color: rgb(97, 189, 109);">Data Management</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: red;">What is the Data Loader?</span></strong></p>
<p>There are a lot of ways to import and export data in bulk from Salesforce (including Import Wizard, exporting Reports, and third-party tools such as dataloader.io), but the Salesforce Data Loader is the original. It&rsquo;s a downloadable client application that is free and provides all of the options you need.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: red;">What is a Custom Metadata Type?</span></strong></p>
<p>Once a tool primarily for Developers, Custom Metadata Types have increasingly become useful for Admins. Custom Metadata is kind of like a custom object, but rather than store data for your organization, it&rsquo;s data about your organization. Things like discount rates, blackout dates, sales goals, etc. are good use cases. The metadata becomes available to you in formulas, automation, etc.</p>
<p>Also, because it&rsquo;s metadata and not data, it&rsquo;s automatically available in all sandboxes you create or refresh.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: red;">What is Salesforce? Cloud computing and benefits?</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Salesforce&nbsp;</strong>is a powerful CRM (Customer Relationship Management) tool that works on cloud computing technology.</p>
<p><strong>Cloud computing:</strong> Technology in which the applications are hosted somewhere (simply called on the cloud) and users can access those applications from anyplace without installing it. Cloud computing provides:</p>
<p>●<strong>&nbsp;Paas (Platform as a service)</strong> PaaS means&rdquo; Platform as a Service&rdquo;. Here in &ldquo;PaaS &ldquo; the cloud service provider provides hardware, OS(operating System), Storage, Network services over the cloud. It is like a rent. If there is no service like Platform, there will be no Applications. Which applications are built on a Platform.</p>
<p>● <strong>Raas (Recovery as a service)</strong></p>
<p><strong>● Saas (Software as a service)&nbsp;</strong><span style="text-align: start; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: medium;">SaaS means Software as a Service. Through this Services all the software&rsquo;s are&nbsp;distributes over the cloud. By using SaaS no need to install any software all&nbsp;software&rsquo;s are readily available over the internet</span></p>
<p><strong>● Maas (Maintenance as a service) etc.</strong></p>
<p><strong>● Iaas (infrastructure as a service).</strong>Full form IaaS is &ldquo;Infrastructure as a Service&rdquo;. Here in IaaS the cloud service providers will provide infrastructure like servers, hosting services and storage. Servers and storage are the basic services provided by Cloud Service Providers.</p>
<p>In salesforce, we use only Paas and Saas. with Paas, a platform to code &ndash; you can develop your own application, Eg: force.com.</p>
<p>With Saas, you can use the application without installing anything on your computer Eg: Salesforce.com.</p>
<p><span style="color: red;"><strong>What is MVC architecture?</strong></span></p>
<p>There are many architectures available like Client server architecture, Standalone architecture etc., Salesforce uses MVC architecture i.e., Model View and Controller Architecture. Model &ndash; It deals with Database designing like Table, fields creation, data types etc., View &ndash; It deals with UI (User interface) customization like Page layout, designing of the page etc., Controller- It controls the data flow between Model and view.</p>
<p>You can use Point and click tools like Workflow, approval process, process builder etc., to achieve the control or you can use Apex programming like Classes and triggers. Design of Database, Table, fields etc.,</p>
